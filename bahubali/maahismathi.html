            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              Mahishmati was originally ruled by a tribal group called Vaithailis.
              They had given shelter to Uthama Mahadeva (a vassal of the
              Kadaraimandlam emperor), who stole the secret Gaurikanth, a special
              stone derived from the volcano Amma Gauri that, if mixed with metal
              weapons, makes the wielder of the weapon invincible. This was exposed to
              his by Ugranappa, the commander-in-cheif of the Vaithalikas army and a
              direct decendant of Kattappa. Uthama Mahadeva started growing a small
              army and bribing men to join him. Eventually, Uthama Varma chases the
              Vaithailis into the forest using Gaurikanth and established Mahishmati
              kingdom. Ugranappa was tricked into becoming a slave. Mahishmati will be
              later on be captured by the Kandaraimandalam Kingdom which then made
              Mahishmati a vassal state.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some mentioned Kings of Mahishmathi after Uthama Mahadeva is
              Parambhattara and Jayadeva. Maharaja Somadeva defeated and granted
              independence once again to Mahishmati. He also defeated the Vaithlikas
              several times including when the Vaithlikas staged a coup. Mahishmati
              prosperd during Maharaja Somadeva's rule and Maharani Hemativi.
              Eventually Mahishmatin again enterd a crisis but eventually it ended.
              The throne eventually was given to Somadeva son, Mahadeva (Vikramadeva).
              Eventually Sivagami took the throne and then Bhalladeva. Bhalladeva was
              deafeated and killed by Mahdedra Baahubali alongside his army who then
              crowned Mahendra as King.
            </p>

            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p>
              Mahishmati is a large empire that contains a wide range of environments,
              as well as small amount of vassal states. The main city of Mahishmati is
              on an island encircled by a river, with the surrounding lands having
              forests. To the west of the city and across the river, are the War
              Fields. The easiest point of entry into Mahishmati for enemy forces is
              at the eastern end of the War Fields, a large flat area with a desert
              environment. The physiological boundaries of Mahishmati are defined with
              the Udayagiri Mountains in the east and the Malava Islands in the west.
              In the south are the forests of Kathari, Surani, and Kalakeya.
            </p>

            <p>
              Located in the north are the vassal states and villages of Mahishmati.
              They include Kuntala (the kingdom of Devasena), Amburi (the village
              where Mahendra grew up), and the Singapuram Bandit's Fort (where
              Sakithan hid after betraying Mahishmati).
            </p>

            <p>
              A large river runs through the entire kingdom of Mahishmati, starting in
              the southeastern part of the Udayagiri Mountains and running north, next
              to Mahishmati and Kuntala, and leading into the waterfall next to
              Amburi.
