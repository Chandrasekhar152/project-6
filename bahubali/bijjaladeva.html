      <h2>Karikala Kattappa Nadaar's Story</h2>
      <p>
        Karikala Kattappa Nadaar (pronounced: KA-ree-KUH-la KUT-up-AH nuh-DAAR),
        known as Kattappa (pronounced: KUT-up-AH), is a main character in the
        Baahubali franchise. He is a member of a lineage of warriors who serve
        the royals of Mahishmati with a status equivalent to a slave, but he is
        the commander and general of Mahishmati's army. He is a skilled and
        strong combatant and mentor to the princes and heirs of the kingdom.
      </p>

      <p>Present Day</p>
      <p>
        Kattappa maintained a reputation as a great warrior and swordsman. One
        time, the weapons trader Sheikh Aslam Khan challenged Kattappa to a
        swordfight after Kattappa declined to buy his weapons. Kattappa
        ultimately won, but Sheikh Aslam Khan promised to become his lifelong
        friend after learning about his honor and loyalty.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the Kunthala Rebel Tribe was trying to rescue Devasena, Avanthika
        asked Jaya Varma if the warrior Kattappa could help them free her. Jaya
        Varma remembered Kattappa from the Battle of the Pindaris, but knew he
        wouldn't betray the throne of Mahishmati.
      </p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>
        During the Battle of the Valley, Kattappa initially fights Mahendra,
        believing him to be a bandit who kidnapped Devasena and is trying to
        kill Bhadra, but recognizes him as Amarendra's son after seeing his
        face. Afterward, Kattappa recounts the story of his father to Mahendra.
        Kattappa joins Mahendra in the Battle of Mahishmati and rallies the
        people of Mahishmati. During the battle, he protects Devasena as she
        does the Trial by Fire. After Mahendra kills Bhallaladeva and becomes
        king of Mahishmati, Kattappa stays as the Commander of the Armed Forces
        of Mahishmati.
