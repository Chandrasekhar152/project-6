      <h1>Bhallaladeva - Baahubali Franchise</h1>

      <h2>Bhallaladeva's Story</h2>
      <p>
        Bhallaladeva (pronounced: BHAAL-laal-DAYV) is a main character and
        recurring antagonist in the Baahubali Franchise, and the main antagonist
        of the movies. He is Lord Bijjaladeva's and Rajmatha Sivagami's son,
        cousin of Amarendra Baahubali, and uncle of Mahendra Baahubali. He is a
        traitorous prince and jealous of his adoptive brother's popularity and
        has plotted against killing him and taking Mahishmati for himself,
        influenced by his father since childhood. He has conspired with Pradhan
        Guru to disgrace Amarendra time and again in Baahubali: The Lost Legends
        and orders Baahubali's execution in Baahubali: The Conclusion. He is
        killed by Devasena in Baahubali: The Conclusion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bhallaladeva wants to create a wedge between Sivagami and Amarendra by
        requesting for marriage with Devasena. Sivagami agrees not knowing
        Amarendra is in love with Devasena. The misunderstanding comes to light
        in Mahismati and Amarendra has to choose the throne or Devasena, he
        chooses Devasena causing Bhallaladeva to be king and Amarendra to be
        commander in chief, though the people show their preference to
        Amarendra.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Devasena's baby shower, Bhallaladeva taunts Devasena causing to yell
        at him and a further assault gets Devasena and Amarendra banished from
        the palace. Despite being banished, they are still living happily
        outside, annoying Bhallaladeva. Bhallaladeva and Bijjaladeva hatch a
        plan and Sivagami orders Kattappa to kill Amarendra. Kattappa kills
        Amarendra and learns he is innocent. Sivagami tells the kingdom the news
        and shows the baby, Mahendra Baahubali, who she escapes with. She is
        killed by Bhallaladeva, who imprisons Devasena. Bhallaladeva destroys
        Kunthala under his tyranny.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shivudu plans to avenge his father's death by raising an army of his own
        with help from Kattappa. They invade Mahishmati and destroy the statue
        during the war and Bhallaladeva is burnt alive on a pyre by Devasena.
      </p>

      <h2 class="superhuman-strength">Superhuman Strength</h2>
      <p>
        Bhallaladeva possesses a tremendous amount of strength through a
        combination of training and genetics. He can easily take on multiple
        opponents at the same time and has been capable of lifting and breaking
        objects that would normally require dozens to hundreds of men. His
        strength was only matched by Amarendra and Mahendra Bahubali and it was
        surpassed by Dharamraj and Pradhan Guru.
