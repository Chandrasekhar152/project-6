      <h1>Rajmatha Sivagami Devi</h1>

      <p>
        Rajmatha Sivagami Devi (pronounced: RAAJ-mah-THA SHIV-gah-MEE DAY-vee),
        known as Sivagami (SHIV-gah-MEE), is one of the main characters in the
        Baahubali franchise. She was a subject of Mahishmati who earned a
        position among the royals and is married to Lord Bijjaladeva. She
        eventually ruled as the acting queen and regent and is the mother and
        aunt of Bhallaladeva and Amarendra Baahubali, respectively. Despite her
        initial poor status, she has become experienced in leadership and combat
        and is a strict follower of traditions. She is known to make tough and
        bold decisions for the good of the kingdom regardless of her personal
        morals if she deems it fit, and can hold her ground in a fight. She dies
        saving Mahendra Baahubali from drowning in a river, allowing him to be
        raised by the Amburi Tribe.
      </p>
      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        She is described as a fiery young woman with extreme intelligence and a
        trained warrior. She was the daughter of the nobleman Devaraya of the
        Mahishmati Kingdom who was executed as a traitor by the king.
      </p>
      <h3>Baahubali: The Beginning</h3>
      <p>
        Sivagami raises her birth son Bhallaladeva and her nephew Amarendra
        Baahubali, whom she takes into her care after the death of his mother,
        and teaches them academics, philosophy, and warfare. In the TV series
        Baahubali: The Lost Legends the two brothers explore their surrounding
        regions and fight to defend their kingdom from the forces of evil.
        Presumably because of the confrontations in The Lost Legends, the
        viscous Kalakeya tribe is at war with Mahishmati and are received by a
        traitor stating the time to lay siege to the kingdom. Chief Inkoshi of
        the Kalakeya insults her, claiming that he'll impregnate her and birth
        heirs once he takes the kingdom. This infuriates both her and Amarendra
        Baahubali who intend to make him pay. Baahubali strategically overcomes
        the Kalakeya's offense and takes Inkoshi hostage, and despite being
        ordered to make him suffer, Bhalla slays him on the spot. Sivagami,
        recognizing Amarendra's kindness in protecting the citizens, decides to
        crown Baahubali the next king of Mahishmati.
      </p>
      <h3>Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        When Kattappa narrates the story of Amarendra Baahubali, she is seen
        with a dagger. Marthanda attempts to take over the throne of Mahishmati.
        It turns out Sivagami bribed his men and Marthanda lunges, but Sivagami
        blocks the sword with her dagger and kills him.
